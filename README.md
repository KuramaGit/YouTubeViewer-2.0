# Viewer-2.0

Viewer 2.0 is a Python framework that uses socks proxies to significantly increase the number of views of your YouTube video!
To install the library, run the command 'pip install -r requirement.txt' and Python will install everything for you automatically.
Then you just have to run the program itself and enjoy.
